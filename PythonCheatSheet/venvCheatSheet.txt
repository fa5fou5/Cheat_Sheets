# Python venv virtual environment cheat sheet

# Create a venv
# To create a virtual environment, go to the root of your project and run

python -m venv venv

It will create a virtual environment called venv

Activate venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Intall packages
pip install pandas pyodbc

Create requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Install packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt


in Linux

When you create a virtual environment using `python -m venv env` or `python3 -m venv env`, the `venv` module also installs a copy of `pip` within the virtual environment. Therefore, once the virtual environment is activated, the `pip` command will be available and associated with the Python version of that virtual environment.

Here are the general steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Check `pip` Version:**

   Once the virtual environment is activated, you can check the version of `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   This `pip` command is specific to the virtual environment and is separate from the system-wide `pip` installation.

4. **Install Packages:**

   You can use the `pip` command within the activated virtual environment to install packages:

   ```bash
   pip install package_name
   ```

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

   When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

The idea behind virtual environments is to create isolated environments for each project, and part of this isolation is having a dedicated `pip` for that environment. This ensures that the dependencies for each project are separate and don't interfere with each other.

Therefore, you don't need to install `pip` separately within each virtual environment; it's automatically included when you create the virtual environment using the `venv` module.
